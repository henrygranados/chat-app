Chat Application
- This application uses socket.io and expressJS
- Simply run "npm i" to install some dependencies
- Then run "npm start"

Features:
1) This application can be use by multiple users at the same.
2) If a user starts typing a message the other users will be able to see right away that this user is typing a message (Example: "Henry is typing a message...").
3) User can exit the chat room by clicking on the "Leave chat" button. Also, If a user leaves the chat room the other users will be notified immediately that a user has left (we can add a message on the message container but for now I'm just deleting that user from the list).

4) If I were given more time to finish this task then I could potentially add the following:
- All of the messages can be stored in a database.
- We can create a Login/Registration page.
- We could possibly display timestamps to the messages and format it by using MomentJS, dateFNS or any other date Javascript library.

Thank you for this oportunity.
Henry Granados
