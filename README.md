# Chat Application
- This application uses socket.io and expressJS
- Simply run "npm i" to install some dependencies
- Then run "npm start"

Features:
- This application can be use by multiple users at the same.
- If a user starts typing a message the other users will be able to see right away that this user is typing a message (Example: "Henry is typing a message...").
- User can exit the chat room by clicking on the "Leave chat" button. Also, If a user leaves the chat room the other users will be notified immediately that a user has left (we can add a message on the message container but for now I'm just deleting that user from the list).

- If I were given more time to finish this task then I could potentially add the following:
 a) All of the messages can be stored in a database.
 b) We can create a Login/Registration page.
 c) We could possibly display timestamps to the messages and format it by using MomentJS, dateFNS or any other date Javascript library.

Thank you for this oportunity.

Henry Granados
